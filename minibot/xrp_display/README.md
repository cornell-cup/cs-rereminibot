## XRP Display


### Setup
Connect the XRP to your computer using a cable. **DO NOT open [xrpcode.wpi.edu](xrpcode.wpi.edu) yet.**

Make sure you are in the working directory `cs-rereminibot/minibot/xrp_display`.

Run the following commands:

`chmod +x display_setup.sh`

`./display_setup.sh`

This puts the display driver (`st7789_fb_plus.py`) and two scripts (`display_example.py` and `display_chuckle.py`) onto the XRP in the correct locations. 

Now open [xrpcode.wpi.edu](xrpcode.wpi.edu). Open and run the `display_example.py` for an example of drawing shapes to the screen. Open and run the `display_chuckle.py` to display a looping animation of eyes chuckling.
